* Clicking on a compilation error opens a new window

Context: editing go. To reproduce:

- simulate a compilation error
- open project vterm
- build the project
- click on the error

Expected: the error is opened in the main window already displaying go code

Actual: a new window is opened to show the error

* Some key bindings break down in org-mode

C-c , buffer navigation conflicts with org-mode settings and stops working when reaching an org buffer.

* No working dabbrev in vterms

There is some code for it but it still does not work. Wrong type of argument: stringp, nil.

* Project buffers do not get custom sorting

Switching to per-project buffers with either C-x p b or C-x b p SPC does not seem to respect custom sorting. Improving
this could make it easier to access recent project buffers.
