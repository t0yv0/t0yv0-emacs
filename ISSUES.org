* Try shift-text package

shift-text-up and shift-text down have to be useful.
Possibly this one actually: https://github.com/emacsfodder/move-text

* Bind M-n, M-p

* Improve xref-find-apropos

This is useful but does not have the same UX polish as VS Code. There could be a consult package
around it.
