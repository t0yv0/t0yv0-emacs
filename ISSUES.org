* Clicking on a compilation error opens a new window

Context: editing go. To reproduce:

- simulate a compilation error
- open project vterm
- build the project
- click on the error

Expected: the error is opened in the main window already displaying go code

Actual: a new window is opened to show the error

* Try vertico unobtrusive

vertico-unobtrusive-mode seems to stay out of the way more now that we learned how to use it.

* Try shift-text package

shift-text-up and shift-text down have to be useful.
Possibly this one actually: https://github.com/emacsfodder/move-text

* Bind M-n, M-p

* Improve xref-find-apropos

This is useful but does not have the same UX polish as VS Code. There could be a consult package
around it.
