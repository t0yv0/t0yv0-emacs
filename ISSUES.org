* Try shift-text package

shift-text-up and shift-text down have to be useful.
Possibly this one actually: https://github.com/emacsfodder/move-text

* Bind M-n, M-p

* Improve xref-find-apropos

This is useful but does not have the same UX polish as VS Code. There could be a consult package
around it.

* Mismatched compilation error links

As explained here:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10451242/how-to-adjust-the-path-that-emacs-compile-goto-error-gets-from-the-compilation

The errors may point to the wrong directory, but it can be fixed.

Also, consult-project-flymake can be preferable to looking at errors in the compilation buffer.
